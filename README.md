# Chromatin Network Visualisations
In this repository there are several Hi-C network visualizations.\
The visualizations can be viewed in a web-browser and are located in the [Visualizations](./Visualizations/) directory.\
To make the usage easier, all pre-processed data files are included in this repository as well.

## Usage
Copy the repository locally to view the visualizations. Use a web browser to open one of the html files, select one of the data files that are also provided here, and the visualization is ready to view. 

## Data pre-processing
This repository contains only visualizations and already processed data that can be used with them, in order to make it faster. The pipeline with all scripts to pre-process example datasets is available in another repository for our modules [ComponentVis](https://github.com/IMCS-Bioinformatics/HiCCliqueGraphs/tree/main/connectedComponents) and [BioClique](https://github.com/IMCS-Bioinformatics/HiCCliqueGraphs/tree/main/processDifferentDB). To use the visualization with other datasets, some manual adjusting will be needed.
